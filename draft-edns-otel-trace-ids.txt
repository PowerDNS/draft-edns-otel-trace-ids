   NOTE: this diagram will be easier to read if it is two octets wide
   instead of four.

   Version is 0 for this specification.  The Trace ID is 16 octets long
   and is mandatory (or not? if empty, receiver selects one, so that
   empty is just a "please trace" signal.  Although then the sender
   could also just generate a trace ID).  The optional Span ID is 8
   octets long.
